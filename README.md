Historically `.scr` files have a bad history with anti-virus software â€” erroneously positive reports of this screensaver being a Malware or Generic Trojan or Unverified Executable is a [known issue](https://github.com/cDima/Aerial/issues/9), you can help by [reporting the source](https://www.opswat.com/blog/what-do-i-do-if-engine-detects-my-safe-file-threat) of this open source repository to the faulty anti-virus software companies. The builds are verified to be clean.

> Where are the .mov files located on Apple TV servers?

The movie files are [located at apple.com](https://github.com/cDima/Aerial/issues/55), they are cached to your local user directory, usually this: `C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Local\Aerial` 

> There's a red line on the screen saver!

This is an issue with video cards and  Windows Media Player, this can be solved by [disabling 'Demo Mode'](https://github.com/cDima/Aerial/issues/71#issuecomment-250318463).
